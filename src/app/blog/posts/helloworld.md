Hi! I'm Abhilasha! I'm a software developer who graduated from NYU with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2024. I'm a programmer, math nerd, animal lover, digital artist, amateur cook, aspiring web dev, and tabletop role playing game afficionado.

I created this website to showcase my interests and projects. It contains various web apps and documentation about projects I've worked on, and more forthcoming. As of now the site in is a very preliminary state, but it will be updated soon. Check back later to see what I've added!
