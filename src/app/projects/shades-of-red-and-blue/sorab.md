Hello and welcome to "Shades of Red and Blue," an unbiased political quiz that digs deep into the American political scene. This project is all about helping you understand different political ideas using real data to show where you stand on the spectrum.

A political spectrum is a way to visually map out different political views. Labels like "left", "right", "liberal", "conservative" are useful for describing peoples beliefs, but are limited in that they put people into strict boxes. Real opinions are not concrete and exist on a spectrum, and people's views don't always exactly line up with each other. A political spectrum fixes this problem by instead considering shades of gray between the two extremes.

The typical left-right spectrum is well-known and relatively common. It puts people on a scale from left-wing to right-wing. However this model often misses the nuances of political beliefs.

However, many of these tools depend on intuition, which can lead to mixed results. [https://polquiz.com/]

"Shades of Red and Blue" aims to clear up these inconsistencies with a more objective approach. Using machine learning techniques and extensive data from political surveys, this project builds a political spectrum based on hard evidence rather than guesswork.

Methodology
Here's how it works: I used data from the American National Election Survey (ANES) 2020, a detailed questionnaire from around the 2020 US Presidential election. This survey covers a wide range of topics related to political views, including policy preferences and demographic info.

I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the ideological questions in the dataset. PCA helps to reduce the complexity of the data, highlighting the main components that explain the most about political ideology. By assigning weights from the dataset, I created a more accurate and objective political spectrum.
